# Angular Vscode Helper

A package trying to bring some of WebStorm IDE features to vscode.

## Features
- UI Components Suggestion Snippets (Component Tag Autocomplete)
  - Indexing of UI components Packages (by default checks `@angular/material` & `@angular/cdk`, you can add more paths in the extension settings).
  - Indexing of local components (anything defined inside `src/` directory).
